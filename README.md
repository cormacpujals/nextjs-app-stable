This project has two main folders, app-router-data-fetching and to-do, each serve a different purpose. 

1. app-router-data-fetching will hold examples of the following rendering methods: SSR (server-side rendering), SSG (static site generation), CSR (client-side rendering), and ISR, (incremental static site generation). 
2. to-do will be a basic full CRUD Next.js app that connects with a MongoDB database written in TypeScript. So far the tutorials I have seen online fail to show folks simple full stack Next.js apps. Either they are frontend proof-of-concepts, or fully built out ecommerce sites using prisma, postgres, and all of the latest Next features. I want this app to be the stepping stone to those impressive tutorials.

Please reach out if you have any questions and if you'd like to collaborate, please reach out!
