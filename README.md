Project for me to practice the newly stable Next.js app router.

app-router-practice holds examples of the following rendering methods: SSR (server-side rendering), SSG (static site generation), CSR (client-side rendering), and ISR, (incremental static site generation).

I intend to build to-do into a dead-simple full CRUD Next.js app that connects to a MongoDB (an example I have yet to see online)

Both of these are works in progress, so if you have any suggestions please let me know. Nonetheless, I hope they're a help and reach out if you have any questions.
